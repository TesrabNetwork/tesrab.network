Bitcoin, the first peer-to-peer electronic cash system, opened the door to permissionless, private, and trustless
transactions. The Tesrab Network project Tesradex is built on the foundation of the hard work and continuous effort of Bitcoin and other blockchains developers over the last nine years. Our launch is grounded on the appreciation for these developers diligence in making secure networks and their support of free and open source software development.  

> **Abstract**. Tesradex is a fully decentralized, multi-purpose, transparent and auditable blockchain platform built on top of the Liquid Network from Blockstream. A privacy and trustless verification focused system is not an opt-in variable and by building on top of the optimized Liquid Network REST API, users have access to all blockchain data (transaction history, balances, etc.) as well as operations for creating a new transactions — it’s easy to make a transfer, from one holder to another, or exchange of assets (tokens and coins) programmatically. Tesradex Tokens ($TRDX) will be fairly and transparently issued after a dutch auction Initial Coin Offering using a series of smart contracts executed by Proof of Stake (POS) algorithm on Waves Platform. Private, public, founder, or developer allocation are highlighted in the token specification section. Tesradex is run on a free and open source software - open for use and development in any jurisdiction, yet allowing simple additional features for user-based needs.
